      <p>A taxi provider is a company that offers transportation services using taxis, typically through a mobile app or website. Customers can use these platforms to book rides, track the location of their taxi, and pay for the service.Taxi providers typically have a fleet of vehicles and employ drivers who are licensed and insured. The drivers may be independent contractors or employees of the company. The company may also provide training to drivers on how to use the app and provide quality customer service.</p>
    Popular taxi providers include Uber, Lyft, and Didi Chuxing. These companies have disrupted the traditional taxi industry by offering a more convenient and user-friendly service that allows customers to quickly and easily book rides on their smartphones.
